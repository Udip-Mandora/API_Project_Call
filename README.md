                                                                Welcome to ReadMe of Space API Project



This project uses API from NASA & SpaceX to showcase data which is not common

First, I am fetching data from NASA's API to showcase images captured by 7 different type of cameras and 3 different type of rovers. All 7 cameras presents different type
of technology to show images. In addition to that, these images of 7 cameras are taken on different sol which is something I had to be careful of becuase 2 of the 3 rovers
had been out of connection for a while now. 

Secondly, I am using SpaceX API because Elon Musk has sent a car to space and land it on MARS. Now, that is a new thing to do and spaceX is keeping track of that car and
has crated an API to capture all the data regarding to car. I am updating that data everyday so it will give the current update of Tesla Roadster and I have been displaying 
data in table and also, giving images as well which were also fetched from API. 

I have given fonts a bit of space type look to give that feel. 

Overall, I have tried to make it work and fetch data from both the API's succeessfully without any error.
